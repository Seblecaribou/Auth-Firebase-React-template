# React authentication template, using Firebase 

This app is based of a 2020's video by Web Dev Simplified:
-Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k&t=1800s)
-Original git repository [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/React-Firebase-Auth)

I updated some of the code to use react-router-dom v6 and up, and Firebase v9. As for the rest, it is practically identical to Kyle's version.
